arena allocation
    arenas are defined by their lifetimes
    i should have one persistent and one transient, and maybe others
        transient is wiped (current pos set to 0) each frame
        "double-buffer" frame arena, alternatve between two arenas, to have access to last frame

    "scratch" arenas
        if a function need permanent arens, the other arena is the scratch (persistent/frame)
        



optimize collision detection?
    two things
        try move
        check collisions
    'try move' only needs checks against rigid a limited set of entities

    check collisions creates a result, which entities then look at to determine their collisions
    this way we only check each pair of entities once per frame

    if we do this, the player entity should be part of the list of entities

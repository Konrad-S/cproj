you start with many powers
different powers are used to overcome different challenges

as the game progresses and you "level up" you choose which power to LOSE

you need to learn how to overcome the challenges without the powers that seemed specifically designed to beat them
those new ways are harder and require deep knowledge of how the games works
    probably level dependent, you have to make use of everything the level provides you

different areas are dependent on specific powers to varying degrees, so losing one power won't be a big deal for going through a certain area
    maybe?


question:
    is the point that you need more skill and effort to get through without powers, OR
        that you need to gain certain KNOWLEDGE of the games mechanics 


what makes this idea good:
    
    at the start of a game you want to just mess around and use your tools where they seem to fit, blue power beats blue monster etc
    as you gain deeper understanding you are able to use specific non-obvious interactions

    easy enemies usually become trivial to beat, which wouldn't be the case here
        easy enemies can be a good thing since the feeling of mastery is good. This game wouldn't have the traditional power fantasy goodness

Another idea is that you instead learn to use your tools in a more advanced way, which unlocks new parts of the game.

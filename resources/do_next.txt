do next:
    better input handling
        each input, each frame, needs:
            number of presses
            number of releases
            held

        maybe
            multiple press/release in one frame
            order of all inputs within one frame


    edit levels in game
        versioning
            @v1
                etc

        click position
            start drawing new rect from click pos to mouse
            create obstacle on second click

        save to file

            create entire file content (using a bunch of strings) at once
            or write the file line by line

do next:
    text
    monster
        entity?
            id?
        
    build in sublime


possible change
    only one frame arena, aka temp
    store entities in main arena
        instead of removing entries, tag them as dead/removed and write over them next time adding new

    or
    IDs
    ID is index in array of pointers to entities
    when one is removed it stays in array for 1 frame, so that when updating entities, they can get rid of their reference to it
    then the index is free to be used when creating another entity

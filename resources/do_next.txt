do next:
    rect
        float
    world to screen transformation
        is matrix overkill for 2d?

        use size of square
        create moveable camera (draw something else to make sure)


    obstacles
    collision

    then:
        split into win32 and game
            hotload dll
            save/load state

edit levels in game
    plain txt
    one entity per line
    versioning (look this up)

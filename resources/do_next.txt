============ fixes ==========
create_entity(
    the last empty slot doesn't go away
        the last entity keeps getting overwritten

attacking an enemy that is overlapping an obstacle (by walking into it)
    should ignore collision with the obstacle until it stops overlapping it


=========== game features =======
save/load level in asset folder
    save individual levels, instead of single test.txt
    saved level is based on level position
        level position based on which direction the door you go through is
            eg: level_1_1 go right -> level_1_2 go down -> level_0_2
            can go negative
            needs entity editor for doors
                could do all doors go right for now

Health
    player and monster
    display
    handle player death?

word wrapping, currently just continues to the right

=========== editor features =========
entity viewer
    ui that displays selected entitys values
    ability to edit those values
magic numbers in config
reload config while running
    with entity viewer, make these numbers editable from a base 'game' entity

=========== code/project features ==========

operator overloading
    multiply vec2

build in sublime

order of drawing?

possible change
    IDs
    ID is index in array of pointers to entities
    when one is removed it stays in array for 1 frame, so that when updating entities, they can get rid of their reference to it
    then the index is free to be used when creating another entity

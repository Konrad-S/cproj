do next:

    think about how to split game and windows layer
        stuff used in both goes in game.h for now

        i should make a new arena.cpp that both include in their compilation units


    edit levels in game
        plain txt
        one entity per line
        versioning (look this up)
        save using integers for more readable files?

        click position
            start drawing new rect from click pos to mouse
            create obstacle on second click

        save to file

            create entire file content (using a bunch of strings) at once
            or write the file line by line
